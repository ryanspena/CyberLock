# Password Generator

## Description

As much as we all love the "Suggested Password" that browsers offer you, sometimes you'd like it to not include numbers or symbols or solely uppercase over lowercase. This website relieves you of the sometimes daft and tedious task of creating a new password for the security of your account or database. Reusing the same password for multiple accounts can put you at risk for intruders, thus, why this has been created to craft extremely difficult passwords based on your criteria preferences. 

My biggest challenge arose whenever I didn't understand how Javascript truly works (upon EventListeners) and needed a deeper understanding of how to properly write out the syntax. Through time and patience (alongside multiple beginners crash course videos on YouTube) I slowly started to grasp the concept and how to properly write out code for a successful program. 

Now that I have completed this generator, I plan on using it for my own personal needs. As the course goes on I am sure I will brighten up the CSS and add a little spice to the page. 

## Usage

Upon opening the webpage on your default browser, begin by clicking the "Generate Password" button and you'll be prompted to enter the number of characters you would like in your password. Valid digits only and must be at least 12 and up to 128 characters. 

Next you'll be ask a few questions about what type of characters you would like in your password. Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers and/or Symbols. At least one character type must be selected for a password to generate.
